## Healthcare observational databases

- They are increasingly used for the medical research and policy-making
- Partly powered by the advances in interoperability
- OHDSI: one of the main drivers for interoperability

## Papgeorgiou General Hospital

- Large hospital in the northern part of Greece
- Data on more than 1.4 million patients over the past 15 years
- Mapped to OMOP-CDM
- Our main contributions are:
  - Mapping and updating the hospital's database to conform with OMOP-CDM
  - Building and executing software for analyzing this data
  - Assisting interested parts in the development and execution of study protocols

## EHDEN Mega-Study

- Study aimed at leveraging data from all over Europe and N. America
  - 52 databases in total
  - 18 countries
- Aim: Evluate drug incidence and prevalence of drugs with suggested shortages from 2010 to 2024
- New way of analyzing real-world healthcare data
- We are working towards keeping up with that trend
- No other database from Greece other than PGH participated

## DARWIN EU

- Project funded by the EMA
- Builds on top of EHDEN
- Supports EMA on:
  - Evaluation of safety and efficacy of medicines
  - Evaluation of drug use and drug shortages
- PGH has joined the list of the DARWIN EU approved healthcare databases
- Already received the first order for the execution of a study

## OHDSI Evidence Network

- Aim: Create an easily accessible pool of the databases mapped to OMOP-CDM
- Facilitate contact between parts who want to execute a study and data sources
- Do this in a timely manner
- OMOP-CDM facilitates that with
  - Pre-executed diagnostics studies with descriptive statistics for each data source
  - Extensive toolset for out-of-the-box analyses

## Studies in collaboration with hospital doctors

## Pharamceutical industry

- Collaboration with pharmaceutical industry to explore rare diseases
